**AfricaAI: Empowering Citizens through AI-Driven Transparency**

Welcome to the AfricaAI repository! This open-source project is a collaborative effort to build a powerful AI-powered tool that provides Africa’s citizens with accessible and accurate information on their country's laws, regulations, budgets, and financial reports.

Mission
Our mission is to foster transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making across the African continent. We believe that by empowering citizens with knowledge, we can drive positive change and promote a more just and equitable society.

**Key Features (Planned)**

**Question-Answering: **Respond to user queries about local laws, regulations, and financial data.
Information Retrieval: Gather relevant documents and resources to support responses.

**Analysis & Summarization:** Simplify complex legal and financial documents into easily digestible information.

**Personalized Recommendations:** Offer tailored guidance based on user needs and interests e.g. I have x legal issue, help me understand it in context of prevailing laws..

**Remedies:** Clearly propose actionable pathways to legal and political remedies to constitutional violations that interested stakeholders can take e.g. a draft legal suit, lobby letter to members of parliament, meeting agenda with local legislator…
Multi-Language Support: Cater to the diverse linguistic landscape of Africa.

**Accessibility:** Ensure the tool is available both online and offline, via various platforms.
Current Focus: Kenya and Uganda
We're starting with a pilot project called #AfricaAI, focused on providing information about Kenyan and Ugandan laws and finances in the context of the ongoingprotests. We aim to empower Kenyans with the knowledge they need to understand their rights and hold their leaders accountable.

Roadmap

Phase 1: Launch #AfricaAI on Twitter trained on some Kenya and Uganda data sources

Phase 2: Monetize / sustainability - figure out how to make the tool self-sustaining e.g. tokenization?

Phase 3:Expand to other platforms, develop mobile app, and integrate additional features.

Phase 4: Expand to other African countries, customizing the AI model for each context.
